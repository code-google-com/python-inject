Wikipedia, [Dependency Injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)
> The article is not great and a bit messy, but it can be a starting point.

Martin Fowler, [Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection pattern](http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html)
> Good article (as almost all Martin's) with detailed explanations. It might seem a bit outdated after Guice launched.

Guice [User's Guide](http://code.google.com/docreader/#p=google-guice&s=google-guice&t=UsersGuide)
> Guice is a Java dependency injection from Google. Its guide is definitely worth reading, even if you don't use Java.

[PicoContainer's](http://www.picocontainer.org/) site
> Provides a lot of information about DI and has the most complete description of DI types in Java.


Dhanji R. Prasanna, [Dependency Injection](http://www.manning.com/prasanna/)
> This book is a must to read, if you really want to understand DI. It covers both Guice and Spring.
